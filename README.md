# Dungeon Builder
First person text based N dimensional adventure engine for all platforms

## Status
Works in Windows (using pdcurses)
Runs in Linux (using ncurses 6.0) but has issues with colors and key code matching

At this point you can create arbitrarily large directed cyclic graphs, put creatures and objects in the nodes, and kill those creatures with those objects. 

## How To Help
I am amateurish at C/C++, anyone passing through who could do a code review and pass along high level tips on style/organisation etc would be appreicated.

Fixing *NIX specific issues would be appreciated as well. 

Ideas/help for better command parsing?

Setting up a system where game state can be tranmitted via sockets - allowing 'dual monitor' support and cooperative play?
